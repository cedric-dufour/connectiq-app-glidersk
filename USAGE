Global View
-----------

The GliderSK Global view displays all the flight data in a single view, without
any further bells or whistles:
 - Top-Left:
   your current acceleration (G-meter)
 - Top-Right:
   your current rate-of-turn
 - Left:
   your current altitude
 - Center:
   your current finesse
 - Right:
   your current (GPS) heading
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current vertical speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current ground speed


Variometer View
---------------

The GliderSK Variometer displays your current ascent/descent rate both textu-
ally and graphically, using visually appealing colors:
 - GREEN for ascent
 - RED for descent


Varioplot View
--------------

The GliderSK Varioplot graphically displays you ascent/descent rate along your
flight path, using visually appealing colors ranging from:
 - (Bright) GREEN for maximum ascent rate
 - (Bright) RED for maximum descent rate

In addition, the following values will be displayed in the corner of the plot:
 - Top-Left:
   your current altitude
 - Top-Right:
   your current vertical speed
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current ground speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current finesse

By pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button), you will enter the
Variometer Plot control menu:
 - Pan/Zoom:
   enter Pan/Zoom mode, where short pressing the following buttons will
   result in:
     SELECT: switch between zoom in/out, pan up/down, pan left/right
     UP:     zoom in  /OR/ pan up   /OR/ pan left
     DOWN:   zoom out /OR/ pan down /OR/ pan right
 - Settings:
   (see further below)


Rate-of-Turn View
-----------------

The GliderSK Rate-of-Turn displays your current rate-of-turn both textually
and graphically, using visually appealing colors:
 - GREEN for right (starboard) turns
 - RED for left (port) turns


Safety View
-----------

The GliderSK Safety view works by continuously calculating the height (Above
Ground Level) that would be reached at your destination, using a two-pass
algorithm:

 - Pass 1: worst-case finesse and best-case heading
   the height at destination is estimated using your actual ground
   speed (as if heading straight towards that destination) and the
   user-specified reference finesse (or the actual finesse if is lower
   than that).

 - Pass 2: actual (or worst-case) finesse and heading
   IF the resulting height (Above Ground Level) is below or equal to
   the user-specified decision height, the height at destination is
   calculated again, using the *actual* finesse (unless you're ascending,
   in which case the user-specified reference finesse is used) and
   the *actual* speed-towards-destination (which accounts for heading
   vs bearing discrepancies).

Once the estimated or actual height at destination have been computed, alerts
will be issued according to the corresponding height:

 - Critical Alert: red background / high-frequency tone
   when the height is below or equal to the user-specified critical height

 - Warning Alert: yellow background / low-frequency tone
   when the height is below or equal to the user-specified warning height

The GliderSK Safety Monitor displays all critical flight safety information
in a single view, using visually appealing alert colors:
 - Top-Left:
   the name of your current destination
   / OR [short-press the SELECT and UP button] /
   the elevation of your current destination
 - Top-Right:
   the distance to your current destination
 - Left:
   your current altitude
 - Center:
   your current finesse
   / OR (if in ascent) /
   your reference finesse (grayed-out)
 - Right:
   the actual height when reaching your current destination
   / OR (if the corresponding height is above your decision height) /
   the estimated height when reaching your current destination (grayed-out)
 - Bottom-Left:
   your current vertical speed
 - Bottom-Right:
   your current ground speed
   / OR [short-press the SELECT and DOWN button] /
   your current speed towards your current destination

Both Left and Right (altitude/height) fields will have their background:
 - RED if the corresponding height is below the critical height
 - YELLOW if is below or equal the warning height
 - GREEN otherwise.

The Center (finesse) field will have its backround:
 - RED if the actual finesse is below or equal to the reference finesse
 - YELLOW if the actual finesse is above the reference finesse
 - GREEN if in ascent (and the reference finesse is used for calculation)

In case the positioning quality gets below Usable, all fields will turn RED.
If a reasonable "last known" position is available, values will still be displayed
(all grayed-out), otherwise no value will be displayed.

By pressing the SELECT button a first time, the application will allow you to
switch the Top-Left and Bottom-Right fields according to your preference:

By pressing the SELECT button a second time, the application will display the
current (critical) settings:
 - Top-Left:
   the name of your current destination
 - Top-Right:
   the elevation of your current destination
 - Left:
   your chosen critical height
 - Center
   your chosen reference finesse
 - Right:
   your chosen warning height
 - Bottom-Left:
   your chosen decision height
 - Bottom-Right:
   your chosen time constant

By pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button), you will enter the
Safety destination selection menu (and access to the Settings menu):
 - Load Destination:
   load your current destination from the destination memory, ordered
   by distance if your location is available
 - Edit Destination:
   edit the name, latitude, longitude and elevation of your current
   destination OR pick your current location/elevation as destination
 - Save Destination:
   save your current destination to the destination memory (50 slots available)
 - Delete Destination:
   delete a destination from the destination memory
 - Settings:
   (see further below)


Activity Recording
------------------

Unless explicitely stated otherwise for a given view, you may control your
activity recording status (start, pause, resume, save, discard) by pressing the
SELECT button. When recording, the BACK key will act as Lap Key (unless
configured not to do so; see Settings below).

GliderSK adds custom fields to the recorded FIT file:
 - Vertical Speed
 - Rate-of-Turn
 - Acceleration
(which will be plotted in Garmin Connect if your installed the application
through the Garmin ConnectIQ store)

Warning! Gotchas!!!
-------------------

When using GPS devices, you should be aware that:
 - GPS is very accurate for location (latitude/longitude) information;
   even more so when coupled with GLONASS (at the cost of battery usage).
 - (Garmin) UltraTrac feature is very cool to save battery but does NOT
   refresh location information frequently enough for GliderSK purpose.
      !!! DO NOT USE ULTRATRAC WITH GLIDERSK !!!
 - GPS elevation sucks! Really! For (vertically) fast moving objects,
   only barometric altimeter does the job.
      !!! DO NOT USE GPS ELEVATION WITH GLIDERSK !!!
 - When using the barometric altimeter, make sure it is configured to
   act as an altimeter and not a barometer (or any subtle mix of the two).
      !!! DO CONFIGURE THE ALTIMETER TO ACT AS BAROMETER !!!

The ConnectIQ framework does NOT allow applications - like GliderSK - to
control the location source (GPS, GLONASS and/or UltraTrac) or elevation
source (GPS or barometric altimeter). The same applies for barometric alti-
meter mode and calibration. The only way to circumvent that limitation is to
      !!! USE A NATIVE GARMIN APPLICATION BEFOREHANDS !!!
   (the ConnectIQ application will then retain its settings)

Consequently, in order to have the best experience with GliderSK (e.g.
on a Garmin D2 Charlie watch):
 - open the FLY activity and set its Altimeter setting to Pressure
   and its GPS settings to GPS (or GPS+GLONASS)
 - switch to the Barometer widget and set its Watch Mode setting
   to Altimeter
 - switch to the Altimeter widget and use its Calibrate option to
   calibrate your elevation/altitude
