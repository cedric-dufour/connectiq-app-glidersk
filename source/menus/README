ConnectIQ Class Quantity vs. Rich Settings
==========================================

The schoolbook approach of defining one Menu/Picker class - and corresponding
Delegate - for each Settings entry may lead to the cryptic

           "Compiler limit exceeded while assembling globals"

message while attempting to compile the ConnectIQ project, given an internal
limit on the quantity of classes.

The schoolbook approach has thus to be dropped for a more pragmatic approach,
where *generic* classes are defined and *context/item* variables used to select
the corresponding code path.

The source code is a little more bloated but (very) rich settings are possible.

;-)
