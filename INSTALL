GliderSK (Garmin ConnectIQ) App
===============================
Build and installation instructions

Please note these instructions are targeted towards *nix (Linux or Mac OS X)
command-liners (CLI).

If you are more comfortable with Windows or a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
please refer to the Garmin ConnectID Programmer's Guide:

  URL> https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/


Pre-Requesites
--------------

Download and install (decompress) the Garmin ConnectIQ SDK from Garmin website:

  URL> https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/

From here, we'll assume the SDK is located (decompressed) in:

  PATH> /opt/connectiq-sdk-linux


Get hold of GliderSK source code:

  URL> https://github.com/cedric-dufour/connectiq-app-glidersk


If you haven't already done so, generate a ConnectIQ developer key:

  CLI> UMASK=$(umask); umask 077  # you developer key is SECRET!

  CLI> mkdir ~/.secret

  CLI> openssl genrsa \
        -out ~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.pem 4096

  CLI> openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -inform PEM -outform DER \
        -in  ~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.pem \
        -out ~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.der 

  CLI> umask ${UMASK}


Build Environment
-----------------

We'll be using GNU make to build and install the project:

  URL> https://www.gnu.org/software/make/


The following environment variables are available for you to fine-tune the
build environment:

  CIQ_ROOT := /opt/connectiq-sdk-linux
    Garmin ConnectIQ SDK installation folder

  CIQ_MONKEYC := ${CIQ_ROOT}/bin/monkeyc
    Monkey C compiler

  CIQ_SIMULATOR := ${CIQ_ROOT}/bin/simulator
    ConnectIQ simulator

  CIQ_MONKEYDO := ${CIQ_ROOT}/bin/monkeydo
    ConnectIQ simulation launcher

  CIQ_SDK := 2.3.2
    Target SDK version

  CIQ_DEVICE := d2charlie
    Target device

  CIQ_DEVKEY := [no default]

(please see the Makefile.ciq file for more details)


A little help before getting started may be welcome:

  CLI> make help


Debug Build and Simulation
--------------------------

Build the project, including debug symbols:

  SH> export CIQ_DEVKEY=~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.der

  SH> make debug

Launch the project in the device simulator:

  SH> make simulator


Release Build and Installation
------------------------------

Build the project, excluding debug symbols:

  SH> export CIQ_DEVKEY=~/.secret/GarminConnectIQ-developer-key.der

  SH> make release

Connect your device via USB (as USB storage) and install the application:

  SH> export DESTDIR=/path/to/device  # NOT including /Garmin/Apps sub-path

  SH> make install


Alternate devices
-----------------

GliderSK is being developed primarily for and using a D2 Charlie device.

However, you can readily build and install it on any "compatible" device
(featuring ConnectIQ 2.1 and above), e.g. the Fenix 5X:

  SH> export CIQ_DEVICE=fenix5x
  SH> export CIQ_SDK=2.3.2

If you are comfortable with layout resources, you may also port it for other
"form factors" (e.g. square watches, smaller round watches, etc.).
GitHub Pull Request will be welcome, provided they come with a screen capture
of the new (simulated) device.


Enjoy!

See the README file for usage instructions.


Quirks
------

On Debian 8 (Jessie), you will need the libjpeg8 package from Debian 7 (Wheezy)
to be able to run the ConnectIQ simulator:
