* 1.2.20180919a:
  - USE RAW BAROMETRIC PRESSURE AND INTERNAL ALTITUDE DERIVATION
    (using ICAO/ISA official formulas, ICAO Doc 9837)
  - Keep displaying (grayd-out) timers values after Activity Save

* 1.1.20180831a
  - FIX: Erroneous variable used in distance calculation function
  - FIX(?): Prioritize Sensor (barometric?) altitude over Position (GPS?) altitude
  - Apply the EMA filter only to Sensor/Position inputs and use those EMA-filtered values for other derived data
  - Prevent the BACK button to exit the application when Activity has been started
  - Uniformize activity recording control (buttons) in all views
  - Centralize activity recording code (in application class)

* 1.1.20180801a
  - Remove Descent Mk1 form supported devices (not yet upgraded to CIQ 2.4.x)
    REF: https://forums.garmin.com/forum/on-the-trail/wrist-worn/decent-mk1/1361969-descent-mk-still-running-ciq-2-3
  - Reduce the varioplot maximum range from 10 to 5 minutes
    FIX: Watchdog Tripped Error - Code Executed Too Long
  - Added Timers view

* 1.1.20180426b
  - Devel: Switched build system to Jungle file (SDK >= 2.4.0)
  - SDK 2.4.x: Use label attribute instead of tag content for menu(-item) resources
  - SDK 2.4.x: Switch data storage from Object Store to Application.Storage

* 1.0.20171216a
  - FIX: Crash when attempting to record an activity lap (with back key)
  - Perfs: Optimize memory usage (get rid of external settings)
  - Perfs: Optmize memory usage (avoid unnecessary resources and constants)
  - Perfs: Retrieve (cache) drawables resources onLayout()
  - Added support for DescentMk1

* 1.0.20171104a
  - FIX: (hopefully) make Vertical Speed chart appear in Garmin Connect
         activity detail (along Rate-of-Turn and Acceleration charts)

* 1.0.20171103a
  - FIX: Make sure we have a valid latitude/longitude seconds value when editing destination coordinates
  - Display heading (instead of altitude) information in Rate-of-Turn view
  - Do not color altitude GREEN if safety data are not available
  - Do not show "From Current" in destination options if no GPS location is available
  - Remove custom (icons) picker implementation

* 1.0.20171027a
  - Smoothen heading values (EMA) like all other sensor/position values

* 1.0.20171021a
  - Allow position processing to be finalized even with missing destination
  - Show height rather than altitude at destination in Safety view
  - Do not use last known position/course for more than 10 seconds
  - Update UI every 5 seconds (rather than 15) when no position data are available
  - Allow to differentiate Safety from Global view even when no position data are available
  - Consolidate heading-related processing (incl. speed-to(wards)-destination)
  - Never show any data when position accuracy is not available

* 1.0.20171019b
  - FIX (CRITICAL): Safety height calculation for non-metric elevation unit

* 1.0.20171019a
  - Post Tenebras Lux
