  - Allow position processing to be finalized even with missing destination
  - Show height rather than altitude at destination in Safety view
  - Minor comments addition/correction
  - Do not use last known position/course for more than 10 seconds
  - Update UI every 5 seconds (rather than 15) when no position data are available
  - Allow to differentiate Safety from Global view even when no position data are available
  - Bail out of view rendering early when position accuracy is not available
  - Consolidate heading-related processing (incl. speed-to(wards)-destination)
  - Moved variometer processing to its own block
  - Move plot buffer processing where it belongs
  - Never show any data when position accuracy is not available
  - Bail out of processing early if position accuracy is too low
  - Add screenshots for each view (global, variometer, etc.)
  - Bail out of processing early if position has no accuracy data

* 1.0.20171019b
